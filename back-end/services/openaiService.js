â€¢ Please monitor your temperature regularly - if it's above 102Â°F (39Â°C), seek medical attention immediately
â€¢ For the headache, try a cool compress on your forehead and rest in a dark, quiet room
â€¢ Stay well-hydrated with water, electrolyte solutions, or herbal teas like ginger or peppermint
â€¢ You can consider over-the-counter fever reducers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, but please consult a pharmacist or doctor first, especially if you have other health conditions
â€¢ Eat light, easy-to-digest foods like soups, broths, and plain rice

Most importantly, since this has persisted for 3 days, I strongly recommend consulting a healthcare professional to rule out any infections that might need specific treatment. Your health is precious! ðŸ’™`;

â€¢ Steam inhalation can really help - try leaning over a bowl of hot water with a towel over your head
â€¢ Honey and warm lemon water can soothe your throat
â€¢ Rest is essential - your body needs energy to fight off whatever's causing this
â€¢ Stay hydrated with warm fluids like herbal teas, broths, and plenty of water
â€¢ Consider over-the-counter cough suppressants if the cough is disturbing your sleep, but check with a pharmacist first

If your symptoms persist beyond a week or you develop fever or breathing difficulties, please see a doctor.`;

â€¢ Stick to the BRAT diet - Bananas, Rice, Applesauce, and Toast - until things settle down
â€¢ Stay hydrated with small, frequent sips of water or oral rehydration solutions
â€¢ Avoid dairy, fatty foods, and caffeine until you're feeling better
â€¢ Rest as much as possible - your body needs energy to recover
â€¢ Peppermint or ginger tea can help soothe stomach discomfort

If symptoms persist beyond 48 hours or you see blood, please seek medical attention immediately.`;

  return `I'm really sorry to hear you're not feeling well ðŸ˜”. I can hear the concern in your message, and I want to help you through this.

Based on what you've described, here's my advice:
â€¢ Rest is crucial - give your body the time it needs to heal
â€¢ Stay well-hydrated with water, herbal teas, or electrolyte solutions
â€¢ Monitor your symptoms closely and keep track of any changes
â€¢ Don't hesitate to reach out to a healthcare professional for personalized advice

Could you tell me a bit more about your specific symptoms? I want to make sure I give you the best possible guidance. Remember, I'm here to support you! ðŸ’™`;
